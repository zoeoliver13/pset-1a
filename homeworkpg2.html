    <h1>TV Shows</h1>

    <p> A lot of our best childhood memories came from watching tv! All the way from Blues Clues and the Backyardagains to Pokemon and Drake & Josh; Including those nights staying up late and watching Family Guy, or Full House. Even randomly waking up at like 3am to George Lopez playing. Do any of <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwibm8TBp-jkAhXRA2MBHa00DRsQFjAAegQIARAB&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.imdb.com%2Flist%2Fls000718259%2F&usg=AOvVaw0KigV2ZrpOiY7gpeMtHI3f">these,</a> cartoons bring back old childhood memories of sitting down infront of the tv with a bowl of cereal?
<h2> Nickelodeon VS Cartoon Network </h2>

  <p> One internal conflict we all had, and have still not resolved, was trying to decide <em>who had the better cartoons??</em> In my opinion, it all boiled down to Cartoon Network and Nickelodeon. How do they expect us to choose between Code Name: Kids Next Door and Danny Phantom?</p>
<h3> SitComs </h3>

<p> As we got a bit older, a lot of us transitioned from mostly watching cartoons to sit coms. Personally, I think that Disney Channel took the crown for having the best sitcoms, but Nickelodean had some bangers too; like Drake & Josh and ICarly. </p>
