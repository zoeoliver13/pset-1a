  <h1>Music</h1>
  <img src="images/ff.jpg">
  <p>Music in the early 2000s was definitly...interesting. I would describe it as a combination of grunge and pop music and it was really weird, but they're still bops and nostalgic to listen to. Escpecially with our little Ipods. According to <a href="https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/266420/artists-of-the-decade">Billboard.com</a> these were the top ten artists of the early 2000s that made a lot of songs that we know and love. </p>
<ol>
  <li>Eminem</li>
  <li>Usher</li>
  <li>Nelly</li>
  <li>Beyonce</li>
  <li>Alicia Keys</li>
  <li>50 Cent</li>
  <li>Nickelback</li>
  <li>Britney Spears</li>
  <li>Destiny's Child</li>
  <li>Jay Z</li>
  </ol>
<h2> One Hit Wonders </h2>
<p> For some reason the early 2000s had a lot of really good one hit wonders...I just felt that it was an honerable mention. </p>
