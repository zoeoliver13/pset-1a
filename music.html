       <div id="section1">Music in the early 2000s was definetly...interesting. I would describe it as a combination of grunge and pop music and it was really weird, but they're still bops and nostalgic to listen to. Escpecially with our little Ipods. According to <a href="https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/266420/artists-of-the-decade" title="Billboard">Billboard</a> these were the top ten artists of the early 2000s that made a lot of songs that we know and love. <div>

        <li class="first">Eminem</li>
        <li>Usher</li>
